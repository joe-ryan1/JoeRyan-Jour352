<a href="google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> is the best search engine in the world.



2.  Describe the purpose of a DIV tag.

A DIV tag acts as a kind of container, but has no real properties like the p or h1 tags. It serves as a way to organize, contain, and then style different parts of a webpage from scratch.



3.  Write out the basic structure of an HTML page, putting the basic tags in the correct position.  (Note: you don't need to connect it to a stylesheet or include DIV tags or anything like that).

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>

  <body>

  </body

</html>


4.  There are two main "areas" or "sections" in the basic structure of an HTML page. In which area would you put a link to a stylesheet?

In the head.

}


9.  What tag would we use to include an image on an HTML page? Just give me the name of the tag, you don't have to write out all the code.

The <img> tag.


10.  Why do we use media queries?

So that the webpage can adapt to different screens depending on the device or screen being used to view the webpage.


11. What is the main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font?
