    <p>I am a photojournalist specializing in still photography for newspapers
      and online publications. I have experience producing photos for a newspaper
      as well as creating compelling photo essays.</p>

    <h2>Experience:</h2>
      <h3>Senior Staff Photographer</h3>
      <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
      <h5>November 2019 – February 2020</h5>
      <p>I take on 2-3 assignments every week taking photos for various stories,
         often requiring different approaches to photography. I attend local
         university and government meetings, and contact sources for stories
         to get portraits. I also attend large sports games throughout the
         semester like basketball and football, as well as smaller sports like
         lacrosse, gymnastics, baseball, and soccer. I need to be flexible and
         quick on my feet as new assignments are constantly popping up that
         need photos.</p>

      <h3>News & Sports Photographer</h3>
      <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
      <h5>September 2018 – November 2019</h5>

        of story types and photography approaches. I attended small sports games
        on occasion like soccer and lacrosse.</p>
