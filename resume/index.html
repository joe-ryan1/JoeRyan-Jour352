    <div id="title">PHOTOJOURNALIST</div>

    <p class="top">I am a photojournalist specializing in still photography for newspapers
      and online publications. I have experience producing photos for a newspaper
      as well as creating compelling photo essays.</p>

    <div class="sectionheader">Experience:</div>
      <div class="jobtitle">Senior Staff Photographer</div>
      <div class="organization">The Diamondback</div>
      <div class="date">November 2019 – February 2020</div>
      <p class="description">I take on 2-3 assignments every week taking photos for various stories,
         often requiring different approaches to photography. I attend local
         university and government meetings, and contact sources for stories
         to get portraits. I also attend large sports games throughout the
         semester like basketball and football, as well as smaller sports like
         lacrosse, gymnastics, baseball, and soccer. I need to be flexible and
         quick on my feet as new assignments are constantly popping up that
         need photos.</p>
